    text: "I have been a long-time customer of Samuel, and while he was once very good, he has been avoiding my requests for months, offering excuses and being dishonest. After following up multiple times, I was disappointed to discover that he blocked me, which is highly unprofessional. If he had been upfront from the start, it would have been understandable. I am very disappointed in how he handled the situation.",
